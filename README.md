## Summary
While our sample sizes for vine member data and non-vine member data are extremely different, the information we do have pretty clearly shows that vine members to have a favorable bias within their video game product reviews. I would be interested in the breakdown of the other star ratings between vine members and non-vine members as well.  We know that in terms of 'good' reviews, vine members tend to give out a lot of 5 star ratings.  But I'm wondering if they're unsatisfied with their product if they swing just as far the other direction with their ratings. I could see a vast majority of vine members using primarily 1 and 5 star ratings only, where non-vine members may tend to give more modest 2-4 star reviews.
